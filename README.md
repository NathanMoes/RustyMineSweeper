# RustyMineSweeper
## Mine sweeper in rust! Implementing using utf8 for emojis to display the status on the board.
## Interaction will be based on the command line mocking something similar to how chess is played
## (Think of knight to e4 etc)
## bombs, flags, and all the rest will be emojis!
## top of the board will track the current score and the related 
## Initialy the goal is to implement it using commmand line interaction but then to the web as well. 
## Aka it will just use html for display of information to make it easier to interact and more appealing
